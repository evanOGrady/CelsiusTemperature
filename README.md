# CelsiusTemperature

    "Summarize the project and what problem it was solving."
    The program takes temperatures and cities from a text file. The temperatures are in Farenheit. The goal of the program is to write the programas and temperatures in Celsius.
    
    "What did you do particularly well?"
    The naming convenion of all the variables is clear and easy to understand.
    
    "Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?"
    I would put the text into a csv file and put that into the Resources of the project.
    
    "Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?"
    The part that I found to be most challenging was converting secondPart to an int. I was able to solve this by writing int degree = stoi(secondPart);
    
    "What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?"
    Writing from files and variable type conversion.
    
    "How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?"
    I made it readable by writing comments. I made it maintanable by making it simple.
